= Welcome to Quarkus!

Quarkus has received awesome community feedback.
Many many thanks for your warm encouragements, your contributions, your proposals and above all your enthusiasm.
This has gone beyond our wildest expectations.

Let's keep rocking!

Oh by the way, quite a few people ask us whether Quarkus was Open Source?
Of course, all is on https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus[GitHub] under the ASL 2.0 license.
