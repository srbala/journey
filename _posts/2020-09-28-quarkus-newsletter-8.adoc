Long over due Newsletter #8!

Quarkus team and the great community been busy - so busy in fact I missing sending out last months newsletter.

Besides the collection of found stories online (let me know if I missed yours!) we also got a new landing page for Quarkus Insights at: https://quarkus.io/insights. 

Next episode is today where we are talking with the winner of Quarkus hackathon in the IOT category.

For the news below - give it a read and if you feel something is missing or have an article coming out for future Quarkus Newsletter install the https://github.com/maxandersen/url2quarkuspub[bookmarklet] on your laptop and phone to easily submit a story. If you prefer the manual way please https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkusio.github.io/issues[open an issue] with a short description and a url

Enjoy!
