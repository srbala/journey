Our fourth semi-annually Q&A session is happening. 

We meant to do it this week but a case of covid made us take a small break! Instead we will do it on the coming Monday.

To submit questions comment on this blog or the matching post in our https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/discussions/26740[GitHub Discussion forum] or post a tweet using the hashtag https://twitter.com/hashtag/quarkusinsights[#quarkusinsights].

If an existing question is of interest do upvote questions found in our discussion or like a tweet and we'll use that to prioritize the questions.

See you Monday 25. July at https://quarkus.io/insights/ !
