For the first *Quarkus Newsletter* of 2020 we got quite a nice selection!

People trying out the new experimental template engine Qute for Quarkus, migration of existing apps, framework comparisons, MapStruct and an excellent video on deploying Quarkus in the real-world. 

Give it a go and if you feel something is missing or have an article coming out for future Quarkus Newsletter install the https://github.com/maxandersen/url2quarkuspub[bookmarklet] on your laptop and phone to easily submit a story. If you prefer the manual way please https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkusio.github.io/issues[open an issue] with a short description and a url

Enjoy!
