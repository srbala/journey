1.11.3.Final mainly fixes a regression introduced in 1.11.2.Final that makes it impossible to build native executables while using both the RESTEasy and OpenTracing extensions.

It is a safe upgrade for everyone using Quarkus 1.11.

If you are not using 1.11 already, please refer to the https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/wiki/Migration-Guide-1.11[1.11 migration guide].
