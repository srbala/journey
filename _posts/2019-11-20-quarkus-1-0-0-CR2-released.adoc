We have been busy bees fixing the reported issues, improving the documentation and the global developer experience. And we felt that a second candidate release was in order due to some of the changes we made.

**Please, update your applications as soon as possible and, if you encounter any issues, report them quickly so that we can fix them before the Final.**

We plan to release 1.0.0.Final in just a few days on **Monday 25th**.
