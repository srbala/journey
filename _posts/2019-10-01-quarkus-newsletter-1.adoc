Welcome to the first episode of the *Quarkus Newsletter*. This is where we'll post about new found publications related to Quarkus.

If you feel something is missing or have an article coming out for future Quarkus Newsletter posts please https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkusio.github.io/issues[open an issue] with a short description and a url. 

In this first edition I've gathered list of interesting publications since the launch of Quarkus back in March 2019.

Enjoy!
