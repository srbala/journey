This release is a bugfix/usability improvements release so the upgrade from 0.27.0 should be safe.

One new item is that we now have a notion of platform to refer to a set of extensions in the Quarkus ecosystem. Details below on how to use/try it out.

== What's new?

=== New website theme

We just pushed a new theme for the website. We are still working on polishing it but, if you see something weird, please report it in https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkusio.github.io/issues[our tracker].

=== Guides and quickstarts URLs changes

Our guides URLs and our quickstarts directories were not entirely consistent until now. We changed them for more consistency.

We put redirections in place for the guides but we can't do it for the quickstarts directories so if you encounter any broken links on the website, please report them and we'll fix them right away.

Thanks!

=== Enablement of platform in new and existing projects

Quarkus ecosystem is more than just the extensions released with Quarkus core. That is visible on https://code.quarkus.io[code.quarkus.io] where you can find additional Quarkus extensions such as Apache Camel.

In your projects you refer to a part of the ecosystem as a platform - for now there is just one platform outside the `core` fondly named `universe`.

If you use https://code.quarkus.io[code.quarkus.io] you will get it automatically.

If you create new projects you get it by passing `platformArtifactId=quarkus-universe-bom` and `platformVersion=0.28.1` to the project create:

[source,shell,subs=attributes+]
----
mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:0.28.1:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=my-groupId \
    -DprojectArtifactId=my-artifactId \
    -DprojectVersion=my-version \
    -DplatformArtifactId=quarkus-universe-bom \
    -DplatformVersion=0.28.1 \
    -DclassName="org.my.group.MyResource"
----

In existing projects, you for now have to manually update your Quarkus version as usual and then update the BOM reference from `<artifactId>quarkus-bom</artifactid>` to `<artifactId>quarkus-universe-bom></artifactId>`.
