We don't have a ton of big new features in Quarkus 2.13.0.Final but it comes with a ton of small enhancements that should improve your overall experience with Quarkus.

It still comes with some exciting stuff:

 * Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) prevention filter for RESTEasy Reactive (well, security is not always exciting but being well prepared prevents some unnecessary stressful times)
 * Kafka Client Dev UI

It is also worth noticing that a lot of work is invested in improving the performances of Quarkus lately and you should see significant performance boosts from release to release in the next few months.

== Migration Guide

To migrate from 2.12, please refer to https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/wiki/Migration-Guide-2.13[our migration guide].

== What's new?

=== Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) prevention filter

Quarkus now provides a RESTEasy Reactive filter that might help to prevent CrossSite Request Forgery attacks.

RESTEasy Reactive is our default REST layer and is a perfect fit for both reactive and blocking workloads.

It comes in the form of a new extension and you can find all the details in the link:/guides/security-csrf-prevention[dedicated guide].

=== Kafka Dev UI

Quarkus 2.13.0.Final introduces a brand new Kafka Dev UI.
It brings several exciting features allowing you to manage your Kafka instance from Dev UI.
