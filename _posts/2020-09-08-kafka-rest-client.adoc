Another week, another interesting question. 
This week, someone asks me about combining Kafka and the Rest Client. 
That is a recurring subject, and most of the time, the goal is to achieve the following process:

image:/assets/images/posts/kafka-rest-client/kafka-rest-architecture.png[]

In other words, we want to call a remote service for each Kafka message we receive. 
Therefore, we have a first topic ("in") containing the data we are consuming, for instance, "transactions". 
Then, we have the central piece of the architecture: the processing component. 
It consumes the incoming transactions, and for each of them, calls a remote service. 
It also writes the response (produced by the remote service) to another Kafka topic "out".

Implementing this with Quarkus is straightforward, and that's what we will cover in this post.
Thanks to Reactive Messaging and the Rest Client, this should not take more than 20 lines of code!

== The Remote Service

Let's start with the remote service. 
Quarkus offers multiple ways to invoke a remote HTTP service, but let's use the Rest Client as it provides an excellent way to interact with HTTP services without having to handle the low-level details of HTTP.

You can use any HTTP API, but to simplify, let's consider a straightforward remote service, something like:

[source, java]
----
@RegisterRestClient(configKey = "transaction-service")
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
public interface TransactionService {

    @Path("/transactions")
    @POST 
    TransactionResult postSync(Transaction transaction);

    @Path("/transactions")
    @POST 
    Uni<TransactionResult> postAsync(Transaction transaction);

}
----

This service contains two methods calling the same HTTP endpoint.
The first one is synchronous, and so blocks the caller thread until the response is received. 
The second is asynchronous, and the returned `Uni` gets the response when received. 
In this case, the caller thread is not blocked and can do something else. 
We are going to see how to use these methods later, but first, a bit of configuration. 
In the `application.properties` add:

[source]
----
# Configure the transaction-service (rest client)
transaction-service/mp-rest/url=http://localhost:8080
----

Of course, update the URL.
The https://quarkus.io/guides/rest-client[https://quarkus.io/guides/rest-client] guide gives more details about the usage and configuration of the Rest Client.

== Invoking the service for each incoming transaction

Ok, we can call our service, but remember, we want to invoke it for every incoming transaction, and these transactions come from a Kafka topic.
With Reactive Messaging, there is no need to handle Kafka right now. 
We can focus on the logic. 
Let's say we have a *channel* (a stream of data), in which to transit our transactions.
We call this first channel `in`.

We also want to write the responses from the remote service into another Kafka topic.
Again, no need to handle Kafka right now.
Let's say we write the responses into a channel named `out`. 

So, we have the following (incomplete) code:

[source, java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class TransactionProcessor {

    @Incoming("in") // The first channel - we read from it
    @Outgoing("out") // The second channel - we write to it
    public TransactionResult sendToTransactionService(Transaction transaction) {
       // Need to call our service here
    }

}
----

`@Incoming` configures the read channel.
`@Outgoing` configures the written channel.
But, something is missing... we need to call our remote service:

[source, java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class TransactionProcessor {

    private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger("TransactionProcessor");

    @Inject @RestClient TransactionService service;

    @Incoming("in")
    @Outgoing("out")
    @Blocking
    public TransactionResult sendToTransactionService(Transaction transaction) {
        LOGGER.infof("Sending %s transaction service", transaction);
        return service.postSync(transaction);
    }

}
----

First, we inject the Rest Client.
Then, we just invoke it in our method.

You may wonder about `@Blocking`. 
With reactive messaging, you need to indicate when you are using blocking code, as by default, it uses an event loop architecture. 
While convenient, you should not abuse `@Blocking`, as it relies on a thread pool limiting your concurrency. 
But, it keeps your logic synchronous.

### Using Asynchronous operations

We can get rid of `@Blocking` annotation by using the second method provided by the `TransactionService`: `postAsync:`

[source, java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class TransactionProcessor {

    private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger("TransactionProcessor");

    @Inject @RestClient TransactionService service;

    @Incoming("in")
    @Outgoing("out")
    public Uni<TransactionResult> sendToTransactionService(Transaction transaction) {
        LOGGER.infof("Sending %s transaction service", transaction);
        return service.postAsync(transaction);
    }

}
----

Using the *async* variant of the `post` method allows us to remove `@Blocking`. 
We return the `Uni` directly.
When that `Uni` receives the remote service's response, it writes the value to the `out` channel.

### Mapping channel to Kafka

So far, so good.
It's time to connect our code with Kafka.
With Reactive Messaging, we map channels to _connectors_, here Kafka. 
So, we just need to configure the application to indicate that the `in` and `out` channels are Kafka topics.
Once again, edit the `application.properties` file, and add:

```
mp.messaging.incoming.in.connector=smallrye-kafka
mp.messaging.incoming.in.topic=transactions
mp.messaging.incoming.in.value.deserializer=org.acme.model.TransactionDeserializer
mp.messaging.incoming.in.auto.offset.reset=earliest
mp.messaging.incoming.in.enable.auto.commit=false

mp.messaging.outgoing.out.connector=smallrye-kafka
mp.messaging.outgoing.out.topic=output
mp.messaging.outgoing.out.value.serializer=io.quarkus.kafka.client.serialization.JsonbSerializer
```

The first block is about the `in` channel. 
It's connected to the `transactions` Kafka topic.
The data is deserialized with a https://github.com/cescoffier/quarkus-kafka-rest-client-demo/blob/master/src/main/java/org/acme/model/TransactionDeserializer.java[custom deserializer].
The last other properties disable the auto-commit (Reactive Messaging is handling commits for you) and read the data since the last committed offset. 

The second block configures the `out` channel.
We connect it with the `output` Kafka topic and configure the value serializer.
For this simple example, we write the data as JSON.

So, when a transaction is written to the Kafka `transaction` topic, it gets received by our processing component, sent to the remote service, and the result is written to the `output` Kafka topic:

[source]
----
2020-08-27 10:04:44,141 INFO  [TransactionProcessor] (vert.x-eventloop-thread-0) Sending Transaction{name='MacroHard', amount=20} transaction service
2020-08-27 10:04:44,196 INFO  [TransactionResource] (executor-thread-2) Handling transaction MacroHard / 20
2020-08-27 10:04:44,240 INFO  [TransactionProcessor] (vert.x-eventloop-thread-0) Sending Transaction{name='BlueHat', amount=10} transaction service
2020-08-27 10:04:44,245 INFO  [TransactionResource] (executor-thread-2) Handling transaction BlueHat / 10
----

If you look inside the `output` topic, you will see the `TransactionResult` flowing:

### We are done!

With a few lines of code and a bit of configuration, we can read data from a Kafka topic, call a remote service, and write the result to another Kafka topic. Plain simple.
