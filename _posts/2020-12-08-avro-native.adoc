synopsis: How to use Kafka and Avro in a native executable

A few months back, I blogged about https://quarkus.io/blog/kafka-avro/[Quarkus, Kafka, and Avro] (using the Apicurio schema registry).

We developed a simple application, receives HTTP requests, writes Kafka records, and reads them from Kafka.
It uses Avro to serialize and deserialize the records.

At that time, the https://github.com/cescoffier/quarkus-kafka-and-avro[application] was **NOT** working in native mode.

With Quarkus 1.10.2, it's now working in native mode!

== Why didn't it work?

The native compiler does not support everything that is possible to do in Java.
There are cases not yet supported, and Avro is using some of these unsupported constructs.
Fortunately, we can implement _substitutions_ (to replace unsupported constructs in the code directly) and use Quarkus extensions to configure the compiler correctly.
As a result, your application does not have to configure anything, "it just works™️".

Let's come back to Avro.
Avro uses https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/lang/invoke/MethodHandles.html[method handles] that are not supported by the GraalVM native compiler.

To workaround the unsupported constructs used by Avro, we implemented a set of https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/master/extensions/avro/runtime/src/main/java/io/quarkus/avro/graal/AvroSubstitutions.java[substitutions].
We replaced method handles with reflection.

The `GenericDatumReader` also needs a bit of work as it touches threads at build time.

Finally, in the Quarkus Avro Processor (part of the Quarkus extension), we register for reflection all the classes annotated with `@AvroGenerated`, as we are using reflection to create new instances of them.

== Show me!

Check out the https://github.com/cescoffier/quarkus-kafka-and-avro[code] of the application, and make sure you have GraalVM installed.
Then, build the native executable using:

[source, bash]
----
mvn package -Pnative
----

Grab a coffee or tea, as it may take a few minutes

Start the Kafka broker and the schema registry using:

[source, bash]
----
docker-compose up -d
----

Finally, run the application with `./target/kafka-and-avro-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`.

Send some movies to the application:

[source, bash]
----
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--request POST \
--data '{"title":"The Shawshank Redemption","year":1994}' \
http://localhost:8080/movies

curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--request POST \
--data '{"title":"The Godfather","year":1972}' \
http://localhost:8080/movies

curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--request POST \
--data '{"title":"The Dark Knight","year":2008}' \
http://localhost:8080/movies

curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--request POST \
--data '{"title":"12 Angry Men","year":1957}' \
http://localhost:8080/movies
----

Check they are processed successfully in the application log output:

[source, bash]

The Avro support in native is still experimental.
In the last Quarkus version, we made significant progress, but there may be some uncovered areas.
