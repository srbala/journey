We are very pleased to announce the 1.14.0 release of Quarkus Tools for IntelliJ.
This release adds support for CodeActions and Quick Fixes.

== CodeActions / Quick Fixes

When an error is detected on one of your Quarkus project files, it is highlighted in the source editor
(for instance when you define one property through `@ConfigProperty` but it is not defined.).

If this error can be fixed through an automatic action, it will be available from the `More actions`
context menu or through the `Alt+Enter` key binding.

In this example, we will add a default value for a property defined with `@ConfigProperty`:

In this other example, a MicroProfile REST Client is defined and bound to a REST resource but the
`@RestClient` annotation is missing from the binding:
