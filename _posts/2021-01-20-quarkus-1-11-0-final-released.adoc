For each Quarkus release, it's the same story: it comes with a ton of exciting new features and enhancements... But believe it or not, it's true.

1.11 is an important milestone as it marks the beginning of two amazing new features:

* RESTEasy Reactive,
* Our Dev UI.

But it also comes with many other enhancements be it for Micrometer, for jbang or for our Spring compatibility layer.

And this release wouldn't be so great without all the people who tested our Betas and CR so a big thanks to everyone who participated in testing this release!

== Migration Guide

Eager to migrate your existing applications? Here is https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/wiki/Migration-Guide-1.11[our migration guide for 1.11].

GraalVM 20.3 in its Java 11 flavor is the newly recommended GraalVM version.

== What's new?

=== RESTEasy Reactive

As you probably guessed from the name, this work is a *new JAX-RS implementation* written from the ground up to work on our common *Vert.x* layer and is thus fully *reactive*, while also being very *tightly integrated with Quarkus* and consequently moving a lot of framework specific work
(like annotation scanning and metamodel generation) to *build time*.

RESTEasy Reactive allows you to leverage the widely used and very powerful JAX-RS APIs to expose a REST layer for your application, while gaining a significant improvement in the maximum throughput the application can achieve. The application should also start slightly faster and consume a little less memory.

It got presented in great details by Georgios in https://quarkus.io/blog/resteasy-reactive/[the RESTEasy Reactive announcement].

A detailed documentation is available in the link:/guides/resteasy-reactive[RESTEasy Reactive guide].

=== Dev UI

This is the beginning of a great story:
Quarkus 1.11 offers a UI dedicated to development to make it easier than ever.

Each extension can expose features in this Dev UI, be it to list the CDI beans, list your endpoints, replay your Flyway migrations, deploy to OpenShift... Sky is the limit.

Quarkus 1.11 introduces the infrastructure of this Dev UI and some features already.
If you are an extension developer or wants to do some frontend work, additions and improvements are very welcome.

The Dev UI is available in dev mode only (e.g. `mvn quarkus:dev`) and accessible at the `/q/dev` endpoint by default.

Want to add a feature to the Dev UI? Just have a look at link:/guides/dev-ui[our Dev UI guide].

=== Improved Micrometer support

Our Micrometer support is continuously improving:

* Kafka Streams metrics are now exposed.
* Registries were moved to extensions.

As for registries, the one for **Prometheus** is part of our Core extensions: `io.quarkus:quarkus-micrometer-registry-prometheus`.

The rest of the registries are hosted in the Quarkiverse (our home for additional extensions):

Azure Monitor::
  `io.quarkiverse.micrometer.registry:quarkus-micrometer-registry-azure-monitor`
Datadog::
  `io.quarkiverse.micrometer.registry:quarkus-micrometer-registry-datadog`
JMX::
  `io.quarkiverse.micrometer.registry:quarkus-micrometer-registry-jmx`
SignalFX::
  `io.quarkiverse.micrometer.registry:quarkus-micrometer-registry-signalfx`
Stackdriver::
  `io.quarkiverse.micrometer.registry:quarkus-micrometer-registry-stackdriver`
StatsD::
  `io.quarkiverse.micrometer.registry:quarkus-micrometer-registry-statsd`

If you feel like contributing to these registries or creating new ones,
the https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-micrometer-registry[Quarkus Micrometer Registry project] is the place you are looking for.

=== Spring Data REST

If you are using our Spring Data compatibility layer,
you can now benefit from the Spring Data REST extension to simplify writing a CRUD REST layer.
It is very similar to our REST with Panache extension.

You can find more information about it in link:/guides/spring-data-rest[the dedicated guide].

=== Non application endpoints moved to `/q/`

Quarkus exposes some technical endpoints that are not part of your application (for example, the Health endpoints).

To avoid conflicts with your application endpoints,
they have all been moved to the `/q/` namespace.
Redirects have been added to redirect the old URLs to the new ones.

This root path can be customized with `quarkus.http.non-application-root-path`.

Edit: We discovered some issues with the `/q` namespace introduced in this release that are described link:/blog/path-resolution-in-quarkus/[here]. These issues were resolved in `1.11.5.Final`.

=== Hibernate ORM

Until now, it was only possible to inject the JPA `EntityManagerFactory` and `EntityManager` in your applications.
Starting with 1.11, you can inject the Hibernate ORM-specific `SessionFactory` and `Session` if you need to access their specific methods. 

=== Jackson

`FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES` is now disabled by default for the default CDI-enabled `ObjectMapper`.

See https://quarkus.io/guides/rest-json#jackson for more details about how to go back to the previous behavior.

=== jbang dev mode & platform support

The integration with https://jbang.dev[jbang] now supports enabling development mode and can use Quarkus platforms (BOM) for version management.
For this you need to use jbang v0.62+.

To run it, just pass in `-Dquarkus.dev`, i.e.:

[source, shell]
----
jbang -Dquarkus.dev myapp.java
----

where `myapp.java` for example is the following:

[source, java]
----
//usr/bin/env jbang "$0" "$@" ; exit $?
//DEPS io.quarkus:quarkus-bom:1.11.0.Final@pom
//DEPS io.quarkus:quarkus-resteasy
//DEPS io.quarkus:quarkus-smallrye-openapi

import io.quarkus.runtime.Quarkus;
import io.quarkus.runtime.QuarkusApplication;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;

import static java.lang.System.*;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
@Path("/hello")
public class quarkusrest {

    public static void main(String... args) {
        Quarkus.run(args);
    }

    @GET
    public String sayHello() {
        return "hello from Quarkus with jbang.dev";
    }
}
----

Notice the use of `@pom` in the first line; that instructs jbang to load the pom for the platform and use it for version management and the other dependency versions can be left out. 

Then with dev mode you can edit that file and save it again and Quarkus live reload feature will take care of applying the changes.

Other dev mode features like `https://localhost:8080/q/dev` and `https://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui` are also available.

NOTE: For now this only works for single file jbang scripts, future releases will enable it to work for multiple files too.

=== GraalVM 20.3

The recommended version of GraalVM for Quarkus 1.11 is GraalVM 20.3.
