With the announcement that https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-1-1-0-final-released/[Quarkus 1.1] was available in December 2019,
and after a tremendous effort from all the contributors and community,
we’re excited to announce that Quarkus 1.1 is Eclipse MicroProfile 3.2 compatible!
https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.microprofile/releases/microprofile-3.2[MicroProfile 3.2] was released November 2019,
bringing updates to the Metrics and Health specifications,
but what is MicroProfile and why do I care?
https://microprofile.io/[MicroProfile] creates specifications for developing microservices with Enterprise Java,
making compatibility with MicroProfile a key feature of https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus].

Over the last couple of months,
the team has worked tirelessly to add the various MicroProfile specification TCKs to the https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus] build and hunt down the failures they raised.
With fixes not just in https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus],
but also fixes for dependent libraries such as https://smallrye.io/[SmallRye] and https://resteasy.github.io/[RESTEasy].

With https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus] we’re seeking the best developer experience for cloud-native development.
In addition to the https://microprofile.io/[MicroProfile] APIs we provide support for popular APIs and standards such as
https://hibernate.org/[Hibernate], https://kafka.apache.org/[Apache Kafka],
and a flexible DI implementation that understands CDI annotations and Spring DI.
For more information check out https://quarkus.io/guides/cdi-reference[Quarkus CDI Reference].

Reaching MicroProfile compatibility with https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus] has been a milestone we’ve been seeking for a while now,
including full native compilation support with GraalVM!
The team is eager to get back to bringing new innovations into https://smallrye.io/[SmallRye] for https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus] to utilize,
which may result in new https://microprofile.io/[MicroProfile] specification proposals in the future.

Stay tuned for future updates on what we’re doing.
