On January 22, 2020, we were informed that Quarkus had won the DeveloperWeek DEVIES Awards in the category of Best Innovation in: Code Frameworks/Libraries. As a Kubernetes-native Java stack, Quarkus represents a fundamental shift in modern application development that makes Java a great fit for cloud-native application architectures, such as containers, microservices and serverless. Java developers are able to use Quarkus to build applications that have a faster startup time and take up significantly less memory. Quarkus works out-of-the-box with popular Java standards, frameworks and libraries. Developers can choose the Java frameworks they want for their applications, which can be run in JVM mode or compiled and run in native mode. Quarkus includes developer productivity capabilities, like live coding that immediately applies source code changes to your running application, unified imperative and reactive programming with an embedded managed event bus, unified configuration and easy native executable generation. Quarkus builds applications to consume 1/10th the memory when compared to traditional Java, and can have 300x faster startup times, significantly reducing the cost of cloud resources.

The Quarkus community is thrilled to receive this award and would like to thank the DeveloperWeek DEVIES judges for their vote of confidence. To us, this means we are on the right path and validates the arduous effort that every member of the community puts into the project on a daily basis. This encourages us to work even harder to continue to drive innovation into Quarkus to fulfill the needs of developers and organizations in a hybrid cloud world.

Lastly, we would like to thank everyone, around the world, that has contributed to the development of Quarkus, with code, pull requests, issue creation, documentation, webinars, videos, books, Quarkus tips, articles, blog posts, etc. There is plenty of innovative work in the pipeline so we’d also like to take this opportunity to ask you to get involved in our community. Your opinion and contribution will help Quarkus continue to grow and serve everyone in the developer community.

Get quarked and let’s continue to build hadrons!
