1.11.2.Final is a maintenance release fixing bugs and improving the documentation.

It is a safe upgrade for everyone using Quarkus 1.11.

== What's new?

=== Hibernate ORM

We upgraded to Hibernate ORM 5.4.27.SP1 which fixes an important issue, potentially causing data losses.

Thus the upgrade is highly recommended.
