synopsis: How to implement a simple cache with the Redis data source

In Quarkus 2.11, we introduced a new API to interact with Redis.
The Redis DataSource APIs aim to be simpler, more extensive, and type-safe.
Under the hood, it uses a performant, non-blocking client (that you can also use if you prefer low-level APIs).

In this post, we will introduce this new API and use it to build a cache, one of the main Redis use cases.

== What is Redis?

https://redis.io/[Redis] is an open-source, in-memory data store that can be used as a database, cache, streaming engine, and message broker.
Redis is often used as real-time data stores,  cache backends, data storage for geospatial entities, and so on.
To interact with Redis, you emit _commands_ and receive responses.
These commands target _keys_ and manipulate the associated data.
There are many commands divided into groups, including:

* the BitMap group to manipulate bit vectors
* the Generic group to manipulate the keys
* the Geospatial group to manipulate geo items
* the Hash group to manipulate sets of `+field -> item+` pairs (like `Map` in Java)
* the List, Set, and Sorted Set groups to store list, set, and sorted set of items
* the Pub/Sub group to emit messages on channels and receive them
* the String group to manipulate value (in Redis, Strings represent values including binary, numbers...)
* the Transaction group to execute transactions

You can find the complete list of commands on the https://redis.io/commands/[Redis Commands page].

== The new Quarkus Redis API

The entry point of the new Quarkus Redis API are the two _data sources_ interfaces:

* `io.quarkus.redis.datasource.RedisDataSource` - the imperative (blocking) API
* `io.quarkus.redis.datasource.ReactiveRedisDataSource` - the reactive API

As mentioned above, these APIs are implemented on top of a lower-level client:

The data source APIs follow the command group structure.
For each group, you retrieve an object dedicated to emitting the commands of that group.
In that regard, this new API is not an abstraction of Redis.
You still need to know the command you need.

For example, to manipulate a `Set<Person>`, you will use the following code:

[source,java]
----
record Person(String firstName, String lastName) {}

@ApplicationScoped
class PersonService {

    private final SetCommands<String, Person> commands;

    public PersonService(RedisDataSource ds) {
	    // Retrieve the `set` group
        commands = ds.set(Person.class);
    }

    public void add(Person person) {
	    // Emit the `sadd` command
        commands.sadd("key", person);
    }
}
----

The API manages the serialization and deserialization for you.
Currently, it uses JSON for objects (using Jackson), but soon the API will offer more advanced features.

This example uses the imperative API, but the reactive API is symmetric.

== Implementing a Redis cache

Time for more cohesive code.
Let's imagine the following https://github.com/cescoffier/quarkus-redis-demo[application]:

image::/assets/images/posts/redis-intro/application.png[align="center"]

We have a database storing `Heroes`, a lot of them.
You need to return the 3 most powerful heroes based on their level.
Of course, you can use your SQL ninja skills, but let's imagine that this code was coded a long time ago, cannot be changed, and is very time-consuming:

[source,java]
----
// Dumb approach, don't do this
return new Ranking(Hero.<Hero>listAll()
	.stream()
	.sorted((o1, o2) -> Integer.compare(o2.level, o1.level))
	.peek(h -> {
		// do something very long...
		nap();
	})
	.limit(3)
	.collect(Collectors.toList()));
----

So, one solution to avoid having to re-compute this set of heroes on every call is to cache the result for a bit of time, let's say 10 seconds.
Let's consider that it's acceptable in this case to return a potentially outdated result set.

To use the new Redis API, we need to use the `redis-client` extension.
For users from the previous API, it's the same extension. The previous API is still available but is deprecated, and we plan to remove it at some point.

Now that we can use the  `RedisDataSource`, we can implement the https://github.com/cescoffier/quarkus-redis-demo/blob/735f8cdbe579ef5c13631e8ec6e3ddad6821a3cb/src/main/java/me/escoffier/quarkus/supes/MyRedisCache.java[`MyRedisCache` class] as follows:

[source,java]
----
package me.escoffier.quarkus.supes;

import io.quarkus.redis.datasource.RedisDataSource;
import io.quarkus.redis.datasource.string.SetArgs;
import io.quarkus.redis.datasource.string.StringCommands;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import java.time.Duration;
import java.util.function.Supplier;

@ApplicationScoped
public class MyRedisCache {

    private final StringCommands<String, Ranking> commands;

    public MyRedisCache(RedisDataSource ds) {
        this.commands = ds.string(Ranking.class);
    }

    public Ranking get(String key) {
        return commands.get(key);
    }

    public void set(String key, Ranking result) {
        commands.set(key, result, new SetArgs().ex(Duration.ofSeconds(10)));
    }

    public void evict(String key) {
        commands.getdel(key);
    }

    public Ranking getOrSetIfAbsent(String key,
           Supplier<Ranking> computation) {
        var cached = get(key);
        if (cached != null) {
            return cached;
        } else {
            var result = computation.get();
            set(key, result);
            return result;
        }
    }
}
----

Note that it's a simple cache without any fancy features.
Redis provides more advanced commands to implement more complicated strategies.

The constructor receives the `RedisDataSource` and gets an object to manipulate Redis _values_.
In our case, https://github.com/cescoffier/quarkus-redis-demo/blob/735f8cdbe579ef5c13631e8ec6e3ddad6821a3cb/src/main/java/me/escoffier/quarkus/supes/Ranking.java[`Ranking`] (the top 3 heroes)

The `get` method emits the Redis `get` command to retrieve an already stored ``Ranking(``null` if it does not).

The `set` method emits the Redis `set` command and store a `Ranking` to the passed key.
The command also configures the expiration time.
So, after 10 seconds, the value is removed by Redis.
As mentioned above, the Ranking instance is serialized into a JSON document.

The `evict` method allows removing the stored value.
Multiple commands can do this, such as the `del` or `getdel` (which also returned the stored value).

For our application, we need something a bit more fancy.
We want to check if we have a value in Redis.
If so, uses that value, and if not, compute the value and store it.
This is implemented in the `getOrSetIfAbsent`.

Now, we can just use this cache to avoid the heavy computation on every call (check the https://github.com/cescoffier/quarkus-redis-demo/blob/735f8cdbe579ef5c13631e8ec6e3ddad6821a3cb/src/main/java/me/escoffier/quarkus/supes/HeroService.java[HeroService] class to see the complete code):

[source,java]
----
@Inject
MyRedisCache cache;

public Ranking getTopHeroes() {
    return cache.getOrSetIfAbsent("top", () -> {
                // Dumb approach, don't do this
                return new Ranking(Hero.<Hero>listAll()
                        .stream()
                        .sorted((o1, o2) -> Integer.compare(o2.level, o1.level))
                        .peek(h -> {
                            // do something very long...
                            nap();
                        })
                        .limit(3)
                        .collect(Collectors.toList()));
            });
}
----

To run the application, just start `mvn quarkus:dev` and open your browser to http://localhost:8080:

image::/assets/images/posts/redis-intro/screenshot.png[align="center"]

To see the cache in action, check the time displayed on the page and refresh the page.
Don't forget that the cached value is only valid for 10 seconds (as set in `MyRedisCache`).
So, if you wait 10 seconds, it will recompute the result.

Quarkus comes with a Redis Dev Service that automatically starts a Redis instance on your machine and configures the application. Note that you need to be able to run containers locally to use this feature.

== Conclusion

This post briefly introduces the new Redis API and demonstrates its usage with a cache implementation example.
The complete code is available from this  https://github.com/cescoffier/quarkus-redis-demo[GitHub repo].

The API supports many more features, such as geospatial data, pub/sub, and transactions, which could be used to improve the `getOrSetIfAbsent`  method.
We will cover more advanced use cases in future posts.

You can find more details about the new API in the:

* https://quarkus.io/guides/redis[Quarkus Getting Started guide]
* https://quarkus.io/guides/redis-reference[Quarkus Redis Reference guide]

Also, the Quarkus team is working on integrating https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/27785[Redis as a cache implementation]. So, eventually, you will just need to use `@CacheResult`, and let the magic happens.
