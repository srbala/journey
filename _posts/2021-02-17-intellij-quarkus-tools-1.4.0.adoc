We are very pleased to announce the 1.4.0 release of Quarkus Tools for IntelliJ.
This release enhances codestarts support in the Quarkus project wizard.

== Codestarts

The Quarkus project wizard now highlights codestarts enabled extension with a specific
icon (right to the extension name), similar to code.quarkus.io, allowing users to better
identify codestarts enabled extensions.
