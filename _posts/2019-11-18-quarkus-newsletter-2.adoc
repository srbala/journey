Welcome to the second episode of the *Quarkus Newsletter*. This is where we'll post about new found publications related to Quarkus.

If you feel something is missing or have an article coming out for future Quarkus Newsletter posts please https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkusio.github.io/issues[open an issue] with a short description and a url. 

This time there was a lot of news around our 1.0 announcement; I've not included those unless they added something extra - that still leaves us with a new interesting workshop, articles from community members and a lot of great videos from Devoxx Belgium. 

Enjoy!
