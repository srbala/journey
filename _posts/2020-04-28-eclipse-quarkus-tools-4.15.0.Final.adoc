In a previous link:../eclipse-got-quarkused[post], we announced the
first version of Quarkus Tools for Eclipse. We're now announcing a new version
for Quarkus Tools for Eclipse, including better support for Eclipse Microprofile,
Java 11 and enhancements to the wizard.

== Language support for Kubernetes, Openshift, S2i and Docker properties

There is now completion, hover, documentation and validation for kubernetes.*,
openshift.*, s2i.*, docker.* properties

Enter `kubernetes` prefix:

== Language support for MicroProfile REST Client properties

Likewise, there is now completion, hover, documentation and validation for the
MicroProfile properties from REST Client.

After registering a REST client using `@RegisterRestClient` like so:
[source,java]
----
package org.acme;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.rest.client.inject.RegisterRestClient;

@RegisterRestClient
public interface MyServiceClient {
    @GET
    @Path("/greet")
    Response greet();
}
----

The related MicroProfile Rest config properties will have language feature support
(completion, hover, validation, etc.).

Change the Java code so that the configuration key is changed:
[source,java]
----
package org.acme;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.rest.client.inject.RegisterRestClient;

@RegisterRestClient(configKey = "myclient")
public interface MyServiceClient {
    @GET
    @Path("/greet")
    Response greet();
}
----

and notice the code assist is changed accordingly:

== Language support for MicroProfile Health

Likewise, there is now completion, hover, documentation and validation for the
MicroProfile Health artifacts.

So if you have the following Health class:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.Health;

@Health
public class MyHealth {

}
----

you will get a validation error (as the class does not implement the `HealthCheck`
interface:

image::quarkus26.png[]

Similarely, if you have a class that implements `HealthCheck` but is not annotated with `Health`, some workflow applies:

[source,java]
----
package org.acme;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheck;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheckResponse;

public class MyHealth implements HealthCheck {

    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
        return null;
    }

}
----

you will get a validation error (as the class is not annotated with `Health`
interface:

image::quarkus27.png[]

As there are several ways to fix the problem, then several quick fixes are proposed.

== Better extensions reporting in the Quarkus project wizard

With the Quarkus extensions ecosystem growing, we improved information about extensions
in the Quarkus project wizard.

When you select an extension in the wizard, you will see the extension description in the
lower side of the wizard. If the extension has a guide on the Quarkus web site, a link
will also be displayed and clicking on that link will open the guide on your local web
browser.
