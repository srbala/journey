Time for our semi-annually Q&A session where we drive the episode using your questions!

To submit questions comment on this blog or the matching post in our https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/discussions/22852[GitHub Discussion forum] or post a tweet using the hashtag https://twitter.com/hashtag/quarkusinsights[#quarkusinsights].

If an existing question is of interest do upvote questions found in our discussion or like a tweet and we'll use that to prioritize the questions.

See you Monday 17th January at https://quarkus.io/insights/ !
