== What’s new with Quarkus Tools for Visual Studio Code

The 1.1.0 release of https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-quarkus[Quarkus Tools for Visual Studio Code]
offers more language features for the `application.properties` file and new additions to existing
features like validation and snippets support.

== Value type validation for `application.properties`

For property values, there will now be an error diagnostic
if the expected type does not match the value type.

For the example above, `quarkus.http.cors` expects a `boolean` and
`quarkus.http.port` expects an `int`.

The `item.price` config property was defined in a resource class to
expect a `float` like so: 

.MyResource.java
[source,java]
----
@ConfigProperty(name = "item.price")
float price;
----


== Go to definition support for config properties in `application.properties`

In VS Code, the 'Go to definition' feature is used by holding Ctrl (or ⌘) and
left clicking on the desired config property, or by right-clicking the
desired config property and clicking ‘Go to definition’ in the context menu.

== New snippets

This release also brings new `application.properties` snippets:

`qds` - Configure a Quarkus datasource

`qj` - Configure a Jaeger tracer

== Formatting support for `application.properties`

Thanks to formatting support, it is now possible to
quickly remove extra whitespace or lines that may
cluttering your `application.properties` file.

Another use case for formatting, is adding/removing spacing
around the equals sign.
To add/remove spacing around the equals sign, change
the `quarkus.tools.formatting.surroundEqualsWithSpaces`
setting to `true`/`false` in the VS Code settings.
Then, format the document.

This wraps up the new major features in this release. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please do not hesitate to open a GitHub issue.

Stay tuned for the next release!
