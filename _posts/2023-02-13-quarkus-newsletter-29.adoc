Sascha Moellering's "How to deploy your Quarkus application to Amazon EK" will show you how the Quarkus stack and additional extensions can be used to easily develop applications, compile them natively with GraalVM, package them in container images, and deploy them to an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) cluster.
