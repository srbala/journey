Ever wanted to use Quarkus awesome API's and full feature set from a command line application ? 

Did you need to run a scheduled batch job now and then and not wanting to embed it into your main Quarkus built service ?

Quarkus has thus far been used to write applications that runs via an endpoint i.e. long running webserver via http or short-lived function in a serverless environment.

In Quarkus 1.4 command mode lets you write apps that run without an endpoint and optionally exits immediately.

This enables you to use Quarkus for writing a whole new style of applications - think command line clients (CLI), batch scripts, console apps, etc.

== How to use it

Below is a simple `GreetingMain` class which uses the traditional `GreetingService` from all our quickstarts.

[source,java]
----
import io.quarkus.runtime.QuarkusApplication;
import io.quarkus.runtime.annotations.QuarkusMain;

@QuarkusMain    // <.>
public class GreetingMain implements QuarkusApplication {
  @Inject // <.>
  GreetingService service;

  @Override
  public int run(String... args) throws Exception {   // <.>

    if (args.length>0) {
      System.out.println(service.greeting(arg[0]));
    } else {
      System.out.println(service.greeting(""));
    }

    return 0;
 }
}
----
<.> The `@QuarkusMain` annotation tells Quarkus that this is the main entry point.
<.> The `run` method is invoked once Quarkus starts, and the application stops when it finishes. If you would like to access request scoped beans you can annotate the `run` method with `@ActivateRequestContext`. This is useful to write or reuse your existing business logic using i.e. Hibernate Panache Entity beans query methods.

You can add this to a `GreetingMain.java` and compile to a .jar or to full native (using `mvnw package -Dnative`) and when run you get something like:

```
 ./target/getting-started-command-mode-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner commando

hello commando
2020-04-25 00:14:38,999 INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) getting-started-command-mode stopped in 0.000s
```

=== Clean output

When working with a cli the default console log output can be verbose. For now the best way to turn that off is by setting the following properties:

```
quarkus.log.level=SEVERE
quarkus.hibernate-orm.log.sql=false
quarkus.banner.enabled=false
```

These could be set in a custom profile called `cli` by adding a `%cli.` prefix.

This has some issues and possible solution are being discussed in issue https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/8871[#8871].

=== Development mode

Command mode works with `quarkus:dev` aka. dev-mode.

When you run with `mvn quarkus:dev` you can add `-Dquarkus.args=yourvalue` as arguments you want to pass into the command line. 

`quarkusargs` will be split on whitespace and honors escaped quotes to. Thus with `mvn quarkus:dev -Dquarkus.args="foo bar \"baz qux\""` the app will start and after end look like this:

[source,shell]
----
foo
bar
baz qux
Quarkus application exited with code 0
Press Enter to restart or Ctrl + C to quit
----

You can now Press Enter multiple times to force a rerun and if you edited source code Press Enter will trigger build and then restart with no real overhead.

=== Main methods

As part of adding command mode via a `@QuarkusMain` annotated class you can now have your own `static void main()` method. Below snippet is the minimum to run Quarkus from a main method. 

[source,java]
----
static void main(String ...args) {
    Quarkus.run(args);
} 
----

To use it with the above `@QuarksMain` class would look something like this:

[source,java]
----
static void main(String ...args) {
    Quarkus.run(GreetingMain.class, args);
} 
----

That is all. This allows you to not only customize start/stop of your Quarks app and what many asked for: ability to launch/debug a Quarkus app directly from an IDE.

You can see a fully working example of these classes in the https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-quickstarts/tree/development/getting-started-command-mode[command-mode quickstart].

=== Minimal CLI App

It is worth noticing that your cli app can still be serving out an endpoint - in fact, in the default app as we just made the rest endpoint is still starting and running. You just don't notice it. Quarkus is that fast.

In case you truly want a minimal extension you remove the `quarkus-resteasy` extension in your `pom.xml` and put `arc` instead. 

Then nothing else than your Quarkus main class will be run.

=== What is next ? 

You tell us! What would you like to do with a command app with Quarkus ? 

For now we are enjoying writing CLI's but how many others will join us!
