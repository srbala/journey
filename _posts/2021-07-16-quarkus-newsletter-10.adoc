Ok... it's been a while since our last newsletter but we've been busy working on a new format. We're moved to an email subscription model starting with Issue #10. Our goal is to allow folks to sign up and get the cream of the crop articles delivered to their inbox once a month. 

Check out https://quarkus.io/newsletter/10/[Newsletter #10]!

If you prefer the manual way please https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkusio.github.io/issues[open an issue] with a short description and a url.
