In Quarkus 1.5, we shipped the first version of the https://quarkus.io/guides/grpc-getting-started[gRPC Quarkus extension].

If you are not familiar with https://grpc.io/[gRPC], it's a highly efficient Remote Procedure Call mechanism relying on HTTP/2 and https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers[Protobuf]. 
You can implement and consume gRPC services from any language such as Go, JavaScript, Python, and Java.
gRPC supports bi-directional streams of data as well as the more classical request-reply interation scheme.
gRPC is particularly well suited for microservices.
It provides support for authentication, tracing, and health, 3 major concerns when building microservice systems.

gRPC services are described in `proto` files listing the different methods (`Hello` in the following example) and defining the exchanged messages (`HelloRequest` and `HelloReply`):

[source]
----
syntax = "proto3";

option java_multiple_files = true;
option java_package = "io.quarkus.grpc.examples.helloworld";
option java_outer_classname = "HelloWorld";

package io.quarkus.grpc.example;

service Greeter {
    rpc Hello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {}
}

message HelloRequest {
    string name = 1;
}

message HelloReply {
    string message = 1;
}
----

`protoc`, the Proto Compiler, generates the stub (client) and base implementations (service) from these proto files for the different targetted languages:

To enable the gRPC support in Quarkus, add the `quarkus-grpc` extension. You can do that by adding the following dependency to your project or run the following command.

[source, xml]
.The quarkus-grpc dependency
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
  <artifactId>quarkus-grpc</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

[source, bash]
.Add the quarkus-grpc extension to an existing project
----
mvn quarkus:add-extension -Dextension=quarkus-grpc
----

Of course, you can also select `gRPC` from https://code.quarkus.io/[the project generator].

NOTE: At the moment, the extension does not cover the `protoc` generation, and you need to configure your project to do so. 
You can find an example https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-quickstarts/blob/main/grpc-plain-text-quickstart/pom.xml[here].

The gRPC extension supports:

* implementing gRPC services
* consuming of gRPC services
* plain-text and TLS
* mutual authentication
* the gRPC health and reflection services
* the gRPC "bare" Java API and a Mutiny API that integrates with the reactive APIS from Quarkus. 

Enough _blabla_, time to see it in action:

The code shown in this video is available from this https://github.com/cescoffier/quarkus-grpc-demo[GitHub project].

== More to come!

That's just the first step. 
We have plenty of ideas to make it better. 
First, we want to cover the `protoc` generation and improve the hot-reload experience by allowing modifying these `proto` files at development time.
The support of custom compressors, load-balancers, and name resolvers are also on the roadmap.

We value your feedback a lot so please report bugs, ask for improvements...
