Quarkus Tools for Visual Studio Code 1.3.0 has been released on the
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-quarkus[VS Code Marketplace]
, the first release of the year.


Alongside various bug fixes, this release focused on introducing VS Code support that
accompanies new Quarkus features like `application.yaml` support,
server-side templating support and the Quarkus 1.2 kebab-case `@ConfigProperties` property names.


For a list of all changes, please refer to the
https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-quarkus/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md[changelog].

== URL CodeLens for RESTEasy JAX-RS GET methods
When editing a resource class while the current Quarkus application is running in
development mode (`./mvnw compile quarkus:dev` or `./gradlew quarkusDev`), there
are now CodeLenses that provide the URL for the GET endpoints.

This feature takes into account the path name and the HTTP server port from your
`application.properties` file in order to create the URL.

Clicking on the CodeLens URL will open the URL in your default browser.

Once the Quarkus application stops running, the CodeLens URL will no longer appear.

image::codelensURL2.gif[alt="URL CodeLens"]

Please keep in mind, CodeLens in VS Code are only updated when certain events happen.
If the URL CodeLens does not appear, some easy ways to trigger a CodeLens update
are by switching tabs or by starting to type in any file. Also make sure that the
`quarkus.tools.codeLens.urlCodeLensEnabled` VS Code setting is set to `true`.

== Hover support for `@ConfigProperty` name in Java sources
Hovering over the name value in a `@ConfigProperty` annotation will now display
the value of the hovered property. Currently, the value will either come from
the `application.properties` file, or the default value field.

== Language support for Kubernetes, Openshift, S2i and Docker properties
There is now completion, hover, documentation and validation for `kubernetes.{star}`,
`openshift.{star}`, `s2i.{star}`, `docker.{star}` properties coming from the
https://quarkus.io/guides/kubernetes#enable-kubernetes-support[Kubernetes Quarkus extension].

== Language support for MicroProfile REST Client properties
Likewise, there is now completion, hover, documentation and validation for the MicroProfile properties from REST Client. 

After registering a REST client using `@RegisterRestClient` like so:
[source,java]
----
package com.mycompany.remoteServices;

@RegisterRestClient
public interface MyServiceClient {
    @GET
    @Path("/greet")
    Response greet();
}
----
The related MicroProfile Rest config properties will have language feature support (completion, hover, validation, etc.).

image::mpRest.gif[alt="Language support for MP Rest properties"]

More information about using the MicroProfile REST Client with Quarkus is available on the Quarkus guides 
https://quarkus.io/guides/rest-client[here].

== YAML support (experimental)
The release of 
https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-1-1-0-final-released/[Quarkus 1.1.0.Final],
brought
https://quarkus.io/guides/config#yaml[YAML configuration support],
meaning that you can now configure your Quarkus application with either an `application.yaml`
or `application.properties` file (but try to stick with one!). 

As a result, there is now completion support for `application.yaml` files. Similarly to
`application.properties`, the completion options in `application.yaml` will be in sync with
the Quarkus extensions that are currently available to the current project (in `pom.xml` or
`build.gradle`), therefore giving you only the relevant completion options.

This feature depends on the VS Code
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml[YAML extension].
If it is not currently installed, a new prompt will propose to install it.

Language feature support for the `application.yaml` file is in its experimental stages.
Compared to `application.properties` support, there are some limitations:

.Missing features:
* Go to definition support
* Code action support
* Automatic completion for default values
* Limited config property and value validation support

== Quick Fix to add unknown property namespaces to ignore
There is now a new Quick Fix that helps exclude large groups of unknown properties
from unknown property validation, as long as they share the same parent namespace.


For example, if your application.properties file contains four properties with an
`Unknown property` error like so:

[source,properties]
----
# All four properties cause an 'Unknown property' error
unknown.test1=a
unknown.test2=b
unknown.test3=c
unknown.test4=d
----
Ignoring all four properties from unknown property validation is easily done by
the Quick Fix, which adds `unknown.{star}` to the `quarkus.tools.validation.unknown.excluded`
workspace configuration array.

== Go to definition support for enum values in `application.properties`
Until now, Go to definition was only supported for config property keys and not the values.
This release brings the Go to definition feature for enum values.

== New extensions descriptions toggle
As the number of Quarkus extensions continues to rise, the new extension descriptions in
the extension selection prompts helps recognize and discover new extensions.
The extension selection prompt appears when selecting Quarkus extensions from the
`Quarkus: Generate a Quarkus project` and `Quarkus: Add extensions to current project` wizards.

image::extensionsBeforeAfter.png[alt="Before and after comparison"]

There is also a new button on the top right of the prompt that toggles whether or not
the extension descriptions should appear.

image::toggleDescription.gif[alt="Toggle description"]

== Different ways to open a new Quarkus project
After creating a new project with the `Quarkus: Generate a Quarkus project` wizard there
is now a new prompt that asks you how the new project should be opened.
The following tables describe the before and after changes.

.Before
|===
|Scenarios |Ways to open the new project

|All scenarios
|Open project in a new window
|===

.After
|===
|Scenarios 2+|Ways to open the new project

|A workspace is open
|Open project by adding to current workspace
|Open project in a new window

|An editor is open
|Open project in the current window
|Open project in a new window

|Nothing is open
2+|Open project in the current window
|===

Here is one of the scenarios in action, when a new project has been generated while a workspace is already open.

== Syntax highlighting for Qute languages
https://quarkus.io/guides/qute-reference[Qute]
is a new server-side templating engine created with Quarkus in mind.
This release brings new Qute Language Modes in VS Code: Qute HTML, Qute JSON, Qute YAML
and Qute Text. The new language modes are automatically applied to your current file, if
your fileâ€™s file extensions is `.qute.html`, `.qute.json`, `.qute.yaml` and `.qute.txt`
respectively.

Thanks to the new language modes, Qute-specific syntax highlighting and commenting
are now provided.

For more information about the Qute templating engine, please refer to the
https://quarkus.io/guides/qute[Quarkus templating engine guide].


== Moving Forward
This wraps up the new major features in this release.
If you have any questions, suggestions or feedback, by all means please

For future releases we are aiming to improve
language support for MicroProfile properties, `application.yaml` and Qute languages.

Thank you for reading and stay tuned for the next release!
