This week, I've been asked about a widespread use case around concurrency.
This user wanted to call two microservices _in parallel_, and when both results are received, join them and continue the processing.
Basically, the following pattern:

In a non-reactive approach, both calls would block the caller thread, and, except if you use a worker thread pool, the calls are not concurrent. 
Even if you use a worker thread pool, these threads are likely blocked, consuming resources for nothing. 

But no worries, Quarkus reactive nature and Mutiny have everything to handle this scenario. 

## Let's call two services

In this post, I'm going to use the Vert.x Web Client, a reactive HTTP client. 
It leverages non-blocking I/O to be highly performant and truly non-blocking. 
It does not rely on a hidden thread pool. 
You can also use the Quarkus Rest Client, but, at the moment, it still uses worker threads.

No matter which client we use, we need some remote services to call.
Let's use:

* https://programming-quotes-api.herokuapp.com/ - to get a quote about programming
* https://api.chucknorris.io/ - to get a quote about _Chuck Norris_


First thing first, let's see the code required to retrieve our quotes:
While both services are similar, the structure of the response differs a little bit.
So we end up with:

[source, java]
----
private static Uni<String> getProgrammingQuote(WebClient client) {
    return client.getAbs(PROGRAMMING_QUOTE)
            .as(BodyCodec.jsonObject())
            .send()
            .onItem().transform(r -> r.body().getString("en") + " (" + r.body().getString("author") + ")");
}

private static Uni<String> getChuckNorrisQuote(WebClient client) {
    return client.getAbs(CHUCK_NORRIS_QUOTE)
            .as(BodyCodec.jsonObject())
            .send()
            .onItem().transform(r -> r.body().getString("value"));
}
----

These two methods receive a `WebClient`, invoke the services, retrieve the JSON responses, and extract them.
They both return a `Uni`.
So they are asynchronous. 
The result (the quote) is provided _later_ when available.
Also, returning a `Uni` means that the services will only be invoked when someone subscribes to the returned `Uni`.
If you subscribe multiple times, you will call the service multiple times.

## Combining Unis

So far, we have two methods to call our services.
But we want to call them concurrently, as depicted above. 

Mutiny provides a way to _combine_ items produced by `Unis`:

[source, java]
----
Uni<Tuple2<String, String>> tuple = Uni.combine().all()
    .unis(getProgrammingQuote(client), getChuckNorrisQuote(client))
    .asTuple();
----

When someone subscribes to the `Uni tuple`, it subscribes to the `getProgrammingQuote(client)` and `getChuckNorrisQuote(client)` `Unis`, which invoke the services.
So the requests are emitted, and the services are invoked concurrently. 

When both responses are available, it combines them into a _Tuple_, a simple structure carrying multiple items.

In other words, concurrently calling our services is pretty straightforward.
Just create the `Unis` representing the services or the asynchronous action you want to achieve and combine them using `Uni.combine().all()`
You can decide to combine the results using _tuples_ or to use a combinator function. 

## Putting everything together

[source, java]
----
// Create a Web Client
WebClient client = WebClient.create(vertx);

// Combine the result of our 2 Unis in a tuple
Uni.combine().all()
        .unis(getProgrammingQuote(client), getChuckNorrisQuote(client))
        .asTuple()

        // Subscribe (which will trigger the calls)
        .subscribe().with(tuple -> {
    System.out.println("Programming Quote: " + tuple.getItem1());
    System.out.println("Chuck Norris Quote: " + tuple.getItem2());
});
