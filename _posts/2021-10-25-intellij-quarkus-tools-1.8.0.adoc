We are very pleased to announce the 1.8.0 release of Quarkus Tools for IntelliJ.
This release adds support for CodeLens for REST endpoints and enhances MicroProfile Fault Tolerance and Metrics supports.

== Codelens

When editing a resource class while the current Quarkus application is running in development mode (`./mvnw compile quarkus:dev` or `./gradlew quarkusDev`), there are now CodeLenses that provide the URL for the REST endpoints.

This feature takes into account the path name and the HTTP server port from your application.properties file in order to create the URL.

Clicking on the CodeLens URL will open the URL in your default browser.

== Microprofile Fault Tolerance

Methods referenced in `@Fallback(fallbackMethod)` are validated:

Activating code completion on the `@Fallback(fallbackMethod)` value will get the list of available methods being proposed:

Invalid use of the `@Gauge` annotation is now reported:
