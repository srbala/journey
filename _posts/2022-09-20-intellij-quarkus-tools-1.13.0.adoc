We are very pleased to announce the 1.13.0 release of Quarkus Tools for IntelliJ.
This release improves the Qute developer experience.

== Improved Qute developer experience

=== InlayHint support

InlayHint is a new feature. It allows to add inline information about parameters and variables. This is very useful for Qute templates to get type information. InlayHints may also be clickable.

=== DocumentHighlight

DocumentHightlight allows to hightlight parts of the document that are related to the current selection. This is useful for Qute templates to highlight matching part of a Qute section.
