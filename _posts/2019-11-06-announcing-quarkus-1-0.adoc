Quarkus is an Open Source stack to write Java applications offering unparalleled startup time, memory footprint and developer experience. It offers familiar programming models and APIs (Hibernate, JAX-RS, Eclipse Vert.x, Apache Camel, Eclipse MicroProfile, Spring API compatibility and more).

Today marks a real milestone for the Quarkus community and the Java community at large. Quarkus 1.0 Candidate Release 1 is out and it will shortly be followed by a 1.0 Final version. The community has worked really hard to up the quality of Quarkus in the last few weeks: bug fixes, documentation improvements, new extensions and above all upping the standards for developer experience. Now it’s time to do your part: test Quarkus 1.0.0.CR1 and join us :).

True to our Open Source roots, we have released early, released often. Since our first announcement of Quarkus back in March 2019, you have seen 30 releases over 36 weeks, that’s one every 9 days with new features each time.

Recent updates include:

 * A reactive core with great support for imperative -  the core networking model of Quarkus supports both reactive and imperative programming models from a single network engine based on Vert.x. Quarkus handles the execution model switch for you.
 * A new security layer that embraces a reactive approach based on Vert.x again.
 * Spring API compatibility including Spring Web and Spring Data JPA as well as Spring DI. 
 * A Quarkus ecosystem: Quarkus wants to have a vibrant ecosystem that goes beyond Quarkus Core. The Quarkus ecosystem - fondly called "universe" - is the set of extensions working together and fully supporting native compilation via GraalVM native image. Anyone can define an extension and publish metadata to be available in our https://code.quarkus.io/[code.quarkus.io] catalog and Maven/Gradle tools. 

Since we released Quarkus back in March, this has been a fantastic journey, we’ve seen an incredible growth in our community (177 contributors and counting) and loads of enthusiasm.

We are hitting 1.0 where backward compatibility becomes important for you and us. But don’t expect a slowdown in feature releases. We have a rock-solid foundation now and tons of ideas to deliver.
