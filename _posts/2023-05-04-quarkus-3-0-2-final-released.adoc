We released Quarkus 3.0.2.Final, the first maintenance release of our 3.0 release train (as our first public release for 3.0 was 3.0.1.Final).

As usual, it contains bugfixes and documentation improvements.

It should be a safe upgrade for anyone already using 3.0.

If you are not already using 3.0, please refer to https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-3-0-final-released/[the Quarkus 3.0 announcement] and in particular the section about the https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-3-0-final-released/#upgrading[upgrade path to 3.0].
