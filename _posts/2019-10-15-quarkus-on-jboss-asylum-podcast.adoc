synopsis: Jason, Emmanuel, Bill and Max on Asylum podcast about the making of Quarkus
---

Last week in a hotel room in Boston I managed to get Jason, Emmanuel and Bill from the Quarkus team to sit down and record episode #46 of JBoss Asylum.

The episode is called "Quarkus to the bones" where we all four go into the details on the why and how on how Quarkus was created and what it is good for - all while having a bit of fun.

The episode is posted on https://asylum.libsyn.com/podcast-46-quarkus-to-the-bones[JBoss Community Asylum] and also marks the 10th year anniversary of the podcast.

Enjoy and have fun!
