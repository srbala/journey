We are very pleased to announce the 1.9.0 release of Quarkus Tools for IntelliJ.
This release adds support for Quarkus streams in the new project/module Quarkus wizard and fixes compatibilities with just released IntelliJ 2021.3.

== Quarkus streams

When a new Quarkus project/module is to be generated, it is now possible to select the Quarkus stream (see https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-2x-platform-quarkiverse-registry/[this article]) on which the generated application will be based on.

By default, the recommended (latest release) will be selected but you can choose another one:
