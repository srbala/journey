Today we're proud to announce our quarkus.io Japanese localization site (https://ja.quarkus.io[https://ja.quarkus.io]) is now open. It is where our valuable guides and blog entries are translated.

Some contents have not been translated yet, but we are continuing to translate them one by one.
We are working on the localization of the contents on a GitHub public repository (https://github.com/quarkusio/ja.quarkus.io[https://github.com/quarkusio/ja.quarkus.io]),
and we are welcoming pull-requests to translate them.
If you are interested in localizing quarkus.io, come and join us!
For more details about how to contribute the localization project, please see https://github.com/quarkusio/ja.quarkus.io/blob/master/translation-guide.ja.md[translation guide(ja)].

We hope https://ja.quarkus.io[https://ja.quarkus.io] will be of great help to the user community in Japan.
