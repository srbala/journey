          format_output: false
          ### Uses prettier https://prettier.io to format jekyll output HTML.
          #
          # prettier_opts: '{ "useTabs": true }'
          ### Sets prettier options (in JSON) to format output HTML. For example, output tabs over spaces.
          ### Possible options are outlined in https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html
          #
          prettier_ignore: '*'
          ### Ignore paths for prettier to not format those html files.
          ### Useful if the file is exceptionally large, so formatting it takes a while.
          ### Also useful if HTML compression is enabled for that file / formatting messes it up.
          #
          # jekyll_src: sample_site
          ### If the jekyll website source is not in root, specify the directory. (in this case, sample_site)
          ### By default, this is not required as the action searches for a _config.yml automatically.
          #
          # gem_src: sample_site
          ### By default, this is not required as the action searches for a _config.yml automatically.
          ### However, if there are multiple Gemfiles, the action may not be able to determine which to use.
          ### In that case, specify the directory. (in this case, sample_site)
          ###
          ### If jekyll_src is set, the action would automatically choose the Gemfile in jekyll_src.
          ### In that case this input may not be needed as well.
          #
          # key: ${{ runner.os }}-gems-${{ hashFiles('**/Gemfile.lock') }}
          # restore-keys: ${{ runner.os }}-gems-
          ### In cases where you want to specify the cache key, enable the above 2 inputs
          ### Follows the format here https://github.com/actions/cache
          #
          custom_opts: '--future'
          ### If you need to specify any Jekyll build options, enable the above input
