--
The schema management strategy, controlling how indexes and their schema
are created, updated, validated or dropped on startup and shutdown.

Available values:

[cols=2]
!===
h!Strategy
h!Definition

!none
!Do nothing: assume that indexes already exist and that their schema matches Hibernate Search's expectations.

!validate
!Validate that indexes exist and that their schema matches Hibernate Search's expectations.

If it does not, throw an exception, but make no attempt to fix the problem.

!create
!For indexes that do not exist, create them along with their schema.

For indexes that already exist, do nothing: assume that their schema matches Hibernate Search's expectations.

!create-or-validate (**default** unless using Dev Services)
!For indexes that do not exist, create them along with their schema.

For indexes that already exist, validate that their schema matches Hibernate Search's expectations.

If it does not, throw an exception, but make no attempt to fix the problem.

!create-or-update
!For indexes that do not exist, create them along with their schema.

For indexes that already exist, validate that their schema matches Hibernate Search's expectations;
if it does not match expectations, try to update it.

**This strategy is unfit for production environments**,
due to several important limitations,
but can be useful when developing.

!drop-and-create
!For indexes that do not exist, create them along with their schema.

For indexes that already exist, drop them, then create them along with their schema.

!drop-and-create-and-drop (**default** when using Dev Services)
!For indexes that do not exist, create them along with their schema.

For indexes that already exist, drop them, then create them along with their schema.

Also, drop indexes and their schema on shutdown.
