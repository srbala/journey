A comma separated list of globs to match resource paths that should be added to the native image. 
 Use slash (`/`) as a path separator on all platforms. Globs must not start with slash. 
 By default, no resources are included. 
 Example: Given that you have `src/main/resources/ignored.png` and `src/main/resources/foo/selected.png` in your source tree and one of your dependency JARs contains `bar/some.txt` file, with the following configuration quarkus.native.resources.includes = foo/++**++,bar/++**++/++*++.txt  the files `src/main/resources/foo/selected.png` and `bar/some.txt` will be included in the native image, while `src/main/resources/ignored.png` will not be included. 
 Supported glob features   Feature Description   `++*++` Matches a (possibly empty) sequence of characters that does not contain slash (`/`)   `++**++` Matches a (possibly empty) sequence of characters that may contain slash (`/`)   `?` Matches one character, but not slash   `++[++abc++]++` Matches one character given in the bracket, but not slash   `++[++a-z++]++` Matches one character from the range given in the bracket, but not slash   `++[++!abc++]++` Matches one character not named in the bracket; does not match slash   `++[++a-z++]++` Matches one character outside the range given in the bracket; does not match slash   `++{++one,two,three++}++` Matches any of the alternating tokens separated by comma; the tokens may contain wildcards, nested alternations and ranges   `++\++` The escape character   
 Note that there are three levels of escaping when passing this option via `application.properties`:  
 . `application.properties` parser 
 - MicroProfile Config list converter that splits the comma separated list 
 - Glob parser  All three levels use backslash (`++\++`) as the escaping character. So you need to use an appropriate number of backslashes depending on which level you want to escape. 
 Note that Quarkus extensions typically include the resources they require by themselves. This option is useful in situations when the built-in functionality is not sufficient.

A comma separated list of globs to match resource paths that should *not* be added to the native image. 
 Use slash (`/`) as a path separator on all platforms. Globs must not start with slash. 
 Please refer to `includes` for details about the glob syntax. 
 By default, no resources are excluded. 
 Example: Given that you have `src/main/resources/red.png` and `src/main/resources/foo/green.png` in your source tree and one of your dependency JARs contains `bar/blue.png` file, with the following configuration quarkus.native.resources.includes = ++**++/++*++.png quarkus.native.resources.excludes = foo/++**++,++**++/green.png  the resource `red.png` will be available in the native image while the resources `foo/green.png` and `bar/blue.png` will not be available in the native image.
