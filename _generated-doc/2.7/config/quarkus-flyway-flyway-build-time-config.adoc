--
Comma-separated list of locations to scan recursively for migrations. The location type is determined by its prefix. 
 Unprefixed locations or locations starting with classpath: point to a package on the classpath and may contain both SQL and Java-based migrations. 
 Locations starting with filesystem: point to a directory on the filesystem, may only contain SQL migrations and are only scanned recursively down non-hidden directories.

--
Comma-separated list of fully qualified class names of Callback implementations to use to hook into the Flyway lifecycle. The `org.flywaydb.core.api.callback.Callback` sub-class must have a no-args constructor and must not be abstract. These classes must also not have any fields that hold state (unless that state is initialized in the constructor).
