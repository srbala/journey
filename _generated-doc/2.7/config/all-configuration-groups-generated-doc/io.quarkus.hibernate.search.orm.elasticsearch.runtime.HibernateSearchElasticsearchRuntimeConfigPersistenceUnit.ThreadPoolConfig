The only reason to alter this setting would be to reduce the number of threads; for example, in an application with a single index with a single indexing queue, running on a machine with 64 processor cores, you might want to bring down the number of threads. \n Defaults to the number of processor cores available to the JVM on startup.","withinAMap":false,"defaultValue":"","javaDocSiteLink":"","docMapKey":"size","configPhase":"BUILD_TIME","acceptedValues":null,"optional":true,"list":false,"passThroughMap":false,"withinAConfigGroup":true,"topLevelGrouping":""}}]
